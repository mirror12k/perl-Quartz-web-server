# perl-Quartz-web-server
A toy minimalistic web server implementation with routing and dynamic pages.
Web server is implemented with a thread pool with a thread spawned for each socket connection.
Dynamic pages are provided by Quartz::Amethyst and written as html files with perl code placed between <$ and $> tags.

Should only be used for expiremental or education purposes, it is otherwise a piece of junk.
I've only cleaned this up and uploaded it in hopes that others may learn from it.
